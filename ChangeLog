Version 0.4.1 to 0.7.0 (beta)

+ Took over sources from Mathias Muller.
+ Changed tileset highlighting which previousely used a swap of two
  fixed pallete colours, to a new tileset format where the designer 
  supplies the selected and unselected tile backgrounds.
+ Changed the main game engine to a 24 bit colour system. This removed
  the old problem where the tileset and background combined could
  only use a maximum of 128 colours. No limitations now exist. For
  low color depths the game screen is dithered.
+ converted the rendering method to use pixmaps and blitting.
+ added a tool bar for commonly used features.
+ Added a tileset load feature (Yeah!!).
+ Added preferences dialog
+ Added preference to disable shadow generation (after complaints
  about 3D visualisation.
+ Configuration and preferences now persist across sessions.
+ Tidied up transparency for tilesets. Now the top left colour of
  the background tile determines the transparency colour, not a
  fixed value of 0.
+ Added a hiscore system based on time taken, tiles removed and
  penalties for using _cheats_
+ Added a game timer to the tool bar.
+ added a hiscore dialog.
+ Added a pause mode for hiscore play (blanks the screen because lets face it
  people cheat).
+ Background images may be tiled or scalled. Saved as a preference
+ The main rendering functions are now independant of the tileset
  metric. In future this will allow for variable size tiles.
+ Added preview dialogs for load background, tileset and game board,
  now you can see what you will get.
+ Added a redo to compliment the undo.
+ Fixed up the menu system and added more accelerators.
+ Added a play with mini-tiles option. Not necessarily for everyone,
  but some people (well at least one, and thats me, so there) use
  kmahjongg on an 800x600 lcd laptop display. So this helps!
+ Added a show removed tiles option. This allows you to determine if
  it is safe to remove a pair etc. Nice aid to game play.
+ Moved the file selectors over to the kde style. This should
  allow urls to be supplied for tilesets, backgrounds and boards etc. In
  future I hope to maintain a web page with new tilesets and layout etc.
  Ultimately it would be nice to have a per-boardlayout internet hiscore
  table (mayhaps in version 0.6)
+ Started documenting how to design tilesets etc.
+ Fixed a few bugs and introduced many (probably)
+ Added an embryonic board editor 
+ Rewrote game generation for new board layout possibilities
+ Speed improvements for tile set load using fixed masks
+ High score now displays time as well as score (requested feature)
+ Plus lots of bits I forgot :-)
